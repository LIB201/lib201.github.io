<p>Why make a map or a timeline? What’s the point? What kinds of questions do these answer?</p>
<p>Think of the data we’ve already gathered in the Smith letters. Which data allow themselves to tell a geographical (i.e.&nbsp;a story across locations) or temporal (i.e.&nbsp;a story across time) story? More importantly (because the map and the timeline aren’t the point in and of themselves!), wow can we <strong>supplement those data with contextual information</strong> that we can incorporate to tell a bigger story?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="primary-and-secondary-source-research">1. Primary and Secondary Source Research</h2>
<p>Before we get into figuring out what all goes into a map or a timeline, the most important thing is to figure out <strong>what questions to ask of our data.</strong> In order to do that, we will be gathering research for this project to give context to the letters – events, themes, and people in the letters – to tell a bigger story. Our timelines and our maps will explore something in the letters, and they will likely contain other primary and secondary sources to explain the significance of an event.</p>
<section id="what-are-primary-sources" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-primary-sources">What are primary sources?</h3>
<p>Primary sources are often considered more “direct” pieces of evidence that are from someone’s individual point of view, or they report on what is happening in the moment. These could include things like: * letters (ahem!) * newspapers * interviews * autobiographies or diaries * photographs * original observations or experiments * original creative works</p>
<p>…and more!</p>
</section>
<section id="bias-in-primary-sources." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bias-in-primary-sources.">Bias in primary sources.</h3>
<p>Just because a primary source is considered direct or in “real time,” it is still from the point of view of someone who (like all of us!) has opinions, perspectives, and bias. All historical documents are written by an author with a specific point of view, and no matter how objective the author may try to appear, their unique perspectives and inclinations influence the document. <em>Keep this in mind!</em></p>
</section>
<section id="what-are-secondary-sources" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-secondary-sources">What are secondary sources?</h3>
<p>Secondary sources are usually interpretive, aren’t usually published, posted, or shared in the moment something is occurring, and they often include primary sources in discussion with ideas or hypotheses. This could include things like * scholarly articles * books and book chapters * websites (blogs, articles, reviews, etc.) * …and more!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finding-resources">Finding Resources</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve figured out the differences between primary and secondary sources, you will use this information to choose sources in different places. For our upcoming projects, we will look in several places, including, but not limited to: * Websites (i.e.&nbsp;blogs, news sites, .orgs, .govs, etc.). * Blogs can show you someone else’s perspective on a related topic, link to other sources, etc. * You can find reports and data on government or organizational websites like the <a href="https://archives.gov">National Archives and Records Administration</a> or <a href="https://www.mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov/">Mississippi History Now</a>, from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. * Wikipedia (gasp!) can even get you started with background information on a topic you’re unfamiliar with! The <b>external and reference links</b> at the bottom of the page are also usually good breadcrubms to follow. * <a href="https://mlp.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/muw">Library books</a>. Books (or book chapters) are a great way to take a deep dive into a topic. For establishing a foundation for a research topic that involves culture, history, major events…books are a great place to start. * Books in the library are great, but you can easily get a book outside of the library! When searching in the catalog, change the drop-down menu from “MUW Library” to “Everything,” and if you find a book outside of MUW, click the Place Hold button. * To broaden the possibilities even further, look for books outside of this partnership<a href="https://worldcat.org"> in the WorldCat database</a>. Request what you find through <a href="https://www.muw.edu/library/research/ill">Interlibrary Loan!</a> * <a href="http://libguides.muw.edu/az.php">Library databases</a>. Search library databases for things like scholarly articles, news, reviews, and more. * Digital collections or archives * Our own <a href="https://athenacommons.muw.edu/">AthenaCommons</a> contains digitized letters from the Smith Papers Collection. * The University of Mississippi’s eGrove repository has a digitized collection of <a href="https://egrove.olemiss.edu/sta_msblubk/">MS Blue Books</a>, which contain historical legislative information and other primary sources relevant to our collection.</p>
<p>To help with research topics, resources, and relevant websites, MUW faculty and staff have started the <a href="https://libguides.muw.edu/smithpapers">Smith Papers Research Guide.</a> Use this to help get started, or to gather more information on a topic.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluating-resources">Evaluating resources:</h3>
<p>By now, you know that not everything you find on the internet is worth using! As you’re looking up resources, keep these things in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Relevance.</b> Determine a source’s relevance to your topic by asking if it will help you get to where you need to go. It might help influence the direction of your research, but that’s ok!</li>
<li><b>Origin of the source.</b> Where is this coming from? What is the domain name? Does the resource <u>cite any references</u>?</li>
<li><b>Purpose of the source.</b> What is this source trying to accomplish? Is it selling a product? Is it to share information/educate? Is it to persuade? Consider if there is an ulterior motive (especially if you’re searching a company or corporation’s website).</li>
</ul>

<section id="citing-and-reusing-sources-ethically" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="citing-and-reusing-sources-ethically">Citing and Reusing sources Ethically</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>We are always taught to cite our sources, so expect the sources you use to do the same! While we are not adopting a specific style for this class (e.g.&nbsp;MLA, APA, CMoS, etc.), look for citation information within a source, and cite the sources you use by hyperlinking pertinent info (e.g.&nbsp;author, title, etc.).</li>
<li>When you do find media you want to reuse, make sure you have the <em>permissions</em> to do so. Since we are creating maps and timelines using open, online tools, ask yourself if the artist/creator would mind you posting their stuff, and if so, ALWAYS give them recognition!</li>
<li>When reusing images, video, etc., be sure the links you use are supported by the platform you’re sharing them on. Not all image and video files will work in all places (for example, see the <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/media-types.html">supported media types used in TimelineJS</a>)! Additionally, be sure you’re copying the correct URL if using an external image.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> permissions to share images can come in the form of usage rights licenses, creative commons licenses, or public domain designations. Look for these notes next to an image in its repository. You can search for images with usage rights in many places, like * <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Commons</a> * <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> * <a href="https://flickr.com/search/">Flickr</a> * Library digital repositories or archives (like <a href="https://msdiglib.org/">MS Digital Library</a>, <a href="https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/">NYPL</a>, and more!) * <a href="https://images.google.com/">Google Images</a> (use the usage rights search feature to filter the results) * <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/">Getty Images</a></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-a-timeline">2. Building a Timeline</h2>
<p>Why create a timeline? If you would like to show the progression of or change in data over time, a timeline will visualize this for you. Both maps and timelines use spreadsheets to associate information with a spot on a “map.” Timelines associate information with dates and ranges of time. Put differently, by pairing references in the letters with other sources along a linear progression, we are putting the letters in a larger context of a year, a few years, a decade, etc.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Before we get into tools, let’s remember that we are telling a story about a progression of thoughts and events over time. To help center the story (and not the website we’re posting it on), let’s sketch an outline of the timeline. In your sketch, you’ll want to consider: * What are the boundaries of my timeline (start date, end date)? * What information from my primary sources do I want to highlight? * What information from my secondary sources will help establish context? * Do I have permission to share images/media from these secondary sources? * Are there themes, ranges of time, or other patterns that I want to highlight among my sources? (Example: you can group things by local v. national event, or tag certain events with a theme, like “desegregation” or “New Deal.”)</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="timeline-tools-timelinejs">Timeline tools: TimelineJS</h3>
<p>Like any project, there are a myriad of tools that you can use. Palladio (our tool for the Network Analysis), for instance, has timeline options! For this lesson, we are going to use <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/">TimelineJS</a>, a template-based story-telling tool developed by Northwestern University’s Knight Lab.</p>
<p>TimelineJS uses Google Sheets to organize dates, add context, include media (photos, videos, sound, etc.), and groups things according to time and tags (See more on this <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/using-spreadsheets.html">here.</a>) So, sign in to your Google MyApps Account before getting started.</p>
<p>Once you have signed in, click <code>Get the Spreadsheet Template</code>, and click “Make a Copy.”</p>

<p>The first row contains the column headings and does not need editing. The 2nd row (the blue one) is going to be your title slide in the timeline, and doesn’t need date metadata. You will see sample information in rows 2-3 that show you what is possible to add.</p>
<p>Begin creating your timeline using the assignment guidelines and filling out your story with metadata (dates, images, captions, etc.)! To publish (i.e.&nbsp;when you’re done), follow steps 2-3 <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make">here</a>.</p>

<p>Maps are layers of data represented by shapes, lines, and points. Layers usually include a: * Base map layer - something you put all of your layers on top of. This could be a historic map, a map with specific boundaries, a topographical map, etc., etc.! * Shapefiles - these are files that contain shapes, lines, and points that correspond to places, and include information on them. An example would be a point (like a city) and its geographical location (latitude, longitude). Other examples can include county boundaries, rivers, buildings, population (census) data, and routes in between locations. These are just a few possibilities! There are 2 kinds of shapefile data: * Vector Data - this is discrete data, like the examples mentioned above. * Raster Data (we will not use raster data in this class) - this includes data that is continuous, like weather patterns or elevation.</p>
<p>Shape files can come in a variety of formats. Most of the time, they will include several files compressed, or zipped (.zip), together. We will see shapefiles in various formats, including: * .kml (or .kmz, if several are compressed in a folder) * .sph * .gpx * .csv</p>

<p>Maps are often built with tables of attributes (or, METADATA!) that correspond to locations–like a spreadsheet that corresponds to geographic plots. It can be challenging to find data sets that: * <b>are relevant to your research.</b> For example, if you wanted to show the proximity of locations to waterways, you’d want to find a map of MS rivers, and not dam locations. Sometimes it’s easy to get distracted by different data sets. * <b>fit within the limits of your software, time, and size requirements.</b> We are using free mapping software, which comes with limits for file types, size, and amount of expertise needed. Some data sets will surpass all of these! * <b>exist!</b> Just like any other type of data, gathering data for a map can be time consuming and specific to the needs of a researcher, so not everything you are looking for will exist. You will have to decide if you need to create a data set from scratch, find one, or pivot your question to accommodate a lack in data.</p>
<p>Some places you might find map data include: * <a href="https://hub.arcgis.com/search?collection=Dataset">ArcGIS Hub</a> - contains open data shapefiles, including government data (city infrastructures, etc.), election data, and more. * <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files.html">US Census Mapping Files</a> - contains regional and geographic boundaries, demographic data, and more. * Local and state entities, like <a href="https://www.maris.state.ms.us/#gsc.tab=0">MARIS</a> - serves as the statewide GIS clearinghouse for Mississippi. * Google - search for the data (e.g.&nbsp;“TVA power lines”) and the filetype (e.g.&nbsp;“shapefile”).</p>
<p>For this map, we are going to use a combination of data that exists, and data that we create using location information from the Smith papers and secondary sources.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ethical-considerations">Ethical Considerations</h3>
<p>Many maps, especially digital mapping projects, use a 2-dimensional representation (i.e.&nbsp;flat) of the earth, which is just a part of the inaccuracies of our world that maps represent. Like historical records, maps and timelines are incomplete choices that represent human experience of the world. As you create maps and/or timelines, consider these questions, adapted from <a href="https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/mapping/lessons/?page=4">DH Institutes Curriculum</a>, that critically examine the process of map-making: * <b>How are you collecting data?</b> Are you gathering data, or using existing data? What are the limitations of either, and what choices lead to this decision (convenience? access? most appropriate?) * <b>What is missing from your data?</b> If you collect population information, which populations are you including/excluding? What boundaries (county? state? neighborhood?) define the map? To give you an idea of what it might take to gather the data you’d like to examine, here’s a snapshot of what you could encounter.</p>
<p><strong>Example research question</strong>: How many men registered for the WWII draft in Mississippi, and where did they go to basic training? (<em>Note: this research question is not perfect and contains some holes, like there is not a database that shows where MS men went to basic training, and it assumes that most MS residents did basic training in MS, which is not true. But for the sake of demonstration…!</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Data obstacles</strong>: There are a couple of major databases that contain the number of WWII enlistees (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fold3.com/title/816/wwii-draft-registration-cards">Fold3.com</a>, <a href="https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/selective-service?_ga=2.58504105.269625778.1632491963-840701876.1629484293#wwii">The National Archives and Records Administration</a>, and <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/1002/">Ancestry.com</a>), but to digitally access this data, there are obstacles: * Proprietary data - in order to access these records at the level we need them for this question (the enlisted’s place of residence), you have to have an Ancestry.com account, which is <strong>not free</strong>, unless you can get to a place with the type of subscription that includes this data (not all subscriptions do! :frowning_face:). * Amount of data/labor - In Mississippi alone, there were over 725,000 men between 21-36 years old that registered for the draft between 1940-1947. (That doesn’t count the additional registrations that happened between 1941 and 1943.) Ancestry allows a maximum of 50 records to view per page, and doesn’t give an option to export the entire contents of the collection into a file like a CSV or XLSX. The options are to * scrape the data through code (which requires permissions and has a high learning curve) * copy and paste the data into a spreadsheet, page by page. With over 725,000 drafted at 50 per page, that is 14,500 pages of data. And it takes 1.5 hours to copy and paste 100 pages’ worth. That would be over 200 hours of copying and pasting…and that doesn’t count the time it would take to clean it! Which brings us to… * Cleaning the data - Copying and pasting 5,000 entries took around 2 hours, but the data copied did not separate the residential information into usable columns, and the data itself had several misspellings and inconsistencies. To clean this, you’d have to separate the location information into separate columns with a split formula, then sort, filter, and remove duplicates to find the inconsistencies. This took about 2 more hours of labor!</p>

<li><strong>Technological obstacles:</strong>
<ul>
<li>After page 100 of the results, Ancestry stopped allowing me to go through page-by-page. (Likely a result of the system preventing me from copying proprietary information.)</li>
<li>As I was searching Google for county information of registrants with missing locations of residence, I tripped an alarm from Google, which thought I was behaving too much like a bot :laughing:</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-layers-to-a-map">Adding layers to a map</h3>
<p>For our map, we are going to use a shapefile of the electric lines owned by the TVA. You can <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qThJx4T1Xqh7hY2tNzgNmHI-YBson8uO/view?usp=sharing">find and download this zipped folder</a> to get started.</p>
<p>In ArcGIS online, you can choose any basemap you’d like, but let’s look at what goes into a shapefile by adding the zipped folder to the map.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click Add, then add layer from file.</li>
</ol>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Screenshot of instructions for how to add a layer from file</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Choose the compressed folder, and click Import Layer. What we’re doing is importing a table that recognizes geocoded information.</p></li>
<li><p>To see what information is included, click on content, and the table icon underneath the shapefile’s title.</p></li>
</ol>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Screenshot of map layer contents</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Take a minute to explore the shapefile’s contents! What can you discern from each column heading, or contents within?</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Now it’s <em>your</em> turn to add data from the Smith Papers and from secondary sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>To create your own data set, think about the data you’ll be collecting, and what all you want to be visible on your map. Each location will have accompanying metadata, which will likely include: * Date * Location<em> </em> Media<strong> * Captions * Details</strong>*</p>
<p>*Location details may differ. Maps often use latitude/longitude for specific locations (which you can easily Google. Pittsboro, MS’s long/lat, for instance, is 33.9400608,-89.3417058). Some maps can translate things like address (street address + city + state) into a point on a map.</p>
