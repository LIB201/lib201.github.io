## Course Description

For this class, we will be using the corpus of letters in the [Smith Papers](https://smithpapers.github.io/) to interrogate various conversations about race, gender, culture, economics, politics, and interpersonal relationships in rural, 20th century Mississippi. Using various digital humanities methods and tools, we will research the impact of these topics in the Smith Papers in a broader context, and we will display our findings in an online space that is visible to the public. In addition to sharing the findings of our research, we will make our research process visible, sharing raw data files, documenting the steps of our process, and detailing our collaborations.

## Objectives and Goals

Students will create 

* Define, digitize, assemble, and create metadata for a circumscribed dataset
* Design several small research projects that experiment with various digital tools and methods, creating a strategy for the project and documenting progress toward defined goals
* Demystify underpinnings of digital research projects, such as algorithms, formulas, and metadata
* Become familiar with various ethical, sociocultural, and technological issues associated with digital research and publishing.
* Synthesize the process of a digital project into a reflective paper that pinpoints the goals of the project, the challenges faced, and strategies used to complete those goals.

## Texts

Links and PDFs for selected readings will be posted to the schedule prior to each meeting. There are no required textbooks or purchases for this class.
