# Overview
For this module, Maps and Timelines are ways for you to engage with the historical and contextual research of the collection. In groups, you will use either a map or timeline to show the progression of events or ideas, either over time or space, and to make an argument about these occurrences. For this assignment, you'll identify a topic within the letters of noted historical significance, research the broader impact of this topic, and put the conversations from the letters within this context.

Remember: **Your project is more than a list of things!** It's a visual argument about how/why they occurred.

# Rubric
Successful maps/timelines will be evaluated on the following criteria: Research, and the resulting timeline *or* map project.

## Research:
- Defines the research question in both the headline of the timeline and the written accompaniment that goes beyond “a series of events” to explore the change over time/space
- Cites Smith Papers at least 5 times, using  relevant examples and excerpts
- Cites at least 5 secondary sources, using relevant contextual information to ground research question

## Timeline/Map project:
- Contains various media (e.g. images, sound, video, etc.) in a majority of entries
- Credits media (both within the Smith Papers Collection and that which is found online) fully
- Contextualizes events with secondary source information within the description text of appropriate entries.
    - Timeline only:
        - Uses at least 2 “groups” to put events into categories
    - Map only: 
        - Uses additional shapefile data to enrich the individually created entries
