## Overview
The Text Analysis assignment is a way for you to engage with the content (or, the text!) of the collection. The point of this assignment is not to _prove_ anything through text analysis tools, but to ask questions and demonstrate the process you undertook to address those questions using different tools. Think of your text anlysis assignment as a scientific experiment that uses words as its test subject!

## Due

## Rubric
Text Analyses that get full credit will be evaluated based on 4 sections of the assignment: the research question, the methods, the results, and further research. 

### The Research Question:
- Clearly defines the purpose of the text analysis in the form of a research question
- Cites at least 2 secondary sources to establish a contextual foundation for the question
- Cites at least 3 primary sources, using them as evidence to reinforce claims made as a result of the text analysis

### The Methods: 
- Clearly define the parameters for inclusion and exclusion of the content set
- Explain the choice of 2 text analysis methods with sound justifications
- Provide detailed cleaning methods for the content set

## The Results:
- Demonstrate the experiment's results with accessibly visual images from text analysis tools
- Provide insight and interpretation into the results of each analysis tool

## Further Research: 
- Clearly defines the limits of the study and how they affected the current results
- Outlines a concrete path for a future study as a result of the current studyâ€™s limitations
