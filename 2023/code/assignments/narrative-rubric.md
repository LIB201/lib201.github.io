You will create a digital exhibit that puts the research we've collected and the artifacts we've created in class into one project that tells a story about the Smith Papers Collection. You are synthesizing the items in the collection with what we've learned so far, and creating a digital story about it.

- Uses narrative elements (text, links, and images) to weave together the mini-projects
- Uses secondary sources to strengthen the validity of the argument within the narrative and mini-projects
- Shares evidence of the digital scholarship (e.g. stop words lists, raw/clean data, explanation of process, etc.) as often and as necessary as possible
- Provides ample text and explanation for all required sections
