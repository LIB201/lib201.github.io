# Digital Prep Assignment

Your work with individually assigned letters from the Smith Papers Collection will be the basis for this assigment. You will submit this work across 3 different submissions: 
- Metadata (worth 50 points)
- Transcriptions (worth 100 points)
- Tags (worth 50 points)

## Metadata
From our Google Sheet, copy and paste the full metadata for the letters you were transcribing into a blank spreadsheet, and submit the .xlsx file to Canvas. Metadata will be checked for fullness (all the fields are filled in) and consistency (they are all formatted according to the guidelines). 

Metadata that receives full credit will:
- complete all metadata fields, following Smith Paper Guidelines formatting consistently
- use Library of Congress subject headings that are relevant and appropriate
- Consider and note harmful content in the letters within appropriate fields

## Transcriptions
Export and upload the .txt files of your assigned transcriptions. The file names should follow our guidelines (mcj-dp018....txt), and the transcriptions should be complete and thorough, representing the letters as faithfully as possible (see [Transcribing lesson 1](/Modules/transcribing.md)! 

Transcriptions that receive full credit will: 
- Maintain structural integrity of the original document through Transkribusâ€™ layout analysis tool
- Transcribe the letters fully and as closely to the original letter as possible, keeping original spelling, markings (where appropriate), punctuation, etc.

## Tags 
Upload the metadata tags (e.g. person, place, organization, etc.) you created for each letter you transcribed. The exported tags will be in an .xls or .xslx format. They should have multiple tabs per sheet for each tag named (e.g. person, place, organization, etc. Each tag category has a separate tab), and there should be an "overview" tab for all tags. It will look something like this:

Tags that receive full credit will: 
- tag all words as explained in our [Tag Definitions](\Modules\transcribing.md\### Metadata tags, defined) list.
