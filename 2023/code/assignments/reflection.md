## Assignment objectives:
Throughout this class, we have focused on how to use different kinds of digital research to interact with archival documents. We have been balancing the line between automating processes with computers, and using computers to do processes manually. Think about how these processes you’ve employed throughout the semester have done this – transcribing texts with an algorithm AND manually, reading letters individually and having a computer read them all, hypothesizing an output of a text analysis mechanism, sorting and classifying data into different groups, finding and creating knowledge and sharing it in an online folder, etc. You have used the computer to process large amounts of data, and for what?

In your reflection essay, think about your experiences in each module of the class, and discuss what is gained through these processes, and possibly, what is lost. How do these processes help your research? How do they impede it?

Finally, what do all of these processes and outputs mean in your interactions with the Smith Papers Collection? What did these digital and manual processes reveal to you about these 100-year-old conversations?

## To sum up:
- Discuss the skills, processes, and tools you had to incorporate for each mini-project
- Discuss the effect these processes had on your projects (feel free to reference the course readings to help make this argument), and what these digital artifacts allow (or disallow) you to do
- Discuss the impact these digital processes had on your engagement with the archival collection

## Paper requirements:
- 3-4 pages (1200-1500 words)
- Include 2-5 links to (or images of) artifacts you reference (e.g. visualizations from mini-projects, cleaning configurations, transcription errors, etc.)
- Submit as a word document to Canvas

## Due: 
In lieu of final exam (due date will correspond with university's exam schedule)
You may share these with me in draft form for comments and feedback before the due date.
