# Overview

## Due

## Submit
Follow [Network Analysis lessons 3 - 4](/Modules/network-analysis.md) for a detailed step-by-step for how to model your data for a network analysis. Submit a document with an image file (or several image files) of your network analysis in Palladio, and include an explanation (about 1-2 pages) of what's going on in the graph, which should give:

- a brief introduction to the collection of letters, or who/what the network represents, and
- a description what the nodes and edges represent within the greater network of the collection of letters.
- any insights you can provide on relationships or nodes to highlight (i.e. notes on who might have the highest degree centrality and why, or which node might serve as a bridge, etc.). If you need to zoom in on parts of the image to do this, include a zoomed-in screenshot of part of the network so that your explanation has a visual aid.

## Rubric
Network Analyses that get full credit will be evaluated based on the explanation, the dataset, and the visualization itself. 

### The explanation:
- Adequately explains how the dataset was modeled and the methods of cleaning data, and links to the original data set
- Makes inferences about the patterns and anomalies in the visualization (e.g. who were the influential players, what the outlying subgroups mean, etc.)

### The dataset:
- is as free from duplicates as possible (keeping “Against Cleaning” in mind!)
- Avoids copy and paste errors. Work done together maintains the “tidiness” of the dataset. 

### The Visualization:
- Contains an images of the network that are clearly visible and demonstrate the analysis from the paragraph
- Uses edges and node sizing to show impact of different people
