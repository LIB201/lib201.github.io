## Introductions {.smaller}
- Dr. Ryan Horne, research consultant in the Office of Advanced Research Computing (OARC) and instructor with the DH program
- Information Sciences / History double major at Penn State (we had electricity then!)
- Software Engineer
- Back to Academia, MA in Ancient History at UCSB, PhD in Ancient History at UNC Chapel Hill
- Various postdocs and research positions since then
- Do a little bit of all DH; specialties in geospatial, networks, and computational humanities

## Introductions
### Partner up!
- Who they are
- Major
- What is a space / place that you feel connected to and why?

## Course Policies
- No late projects!
- If something happens for a reaction or other assignment, let me know
- Expected to be here and attentive
- Participate in discussions from the reading s and activities
- Participate in the labs
	- Data for labs is up to you!


## Course Policies

Discussion guidelines

- Listen attentively. Pay attention to what someone is saying, please no interrupting.
- No name calling. Be respectful of people, and focus on challenging ideas.
- Give and take air time. Who else may be waiting to share their perspective?
- Confidentiality. You should not use what is discussed in this classroom in outside conversations.
- It is okay to make mistakes!!


## Course Resources
- Course materials will be on BruinLearn or linked directly from the schedule
- If you do not have a laptop, let me know!
	- You can e-mail me if you do not want to speak directly about this


## Course Overview
>  In this course, students will study digital mapping techniques used in humanities and social sciences, with an emphasis on equity and social justice issues. Through project-based learning, students will engage about basic geospatial data types, digital gazetteers, and web-based GIS initiatives. Students will work with georeferencing historical maps and sources, visualizing and querying geospatial data, and crafting narratives that use place-based information.



## What will we be doing?
- In-class exercises and learning
- Readings
- Reaction Papers
- Project

## What does this mean?

Think of this course as a *humanities lab* course

- Hands on (bring your laptops!)
- Applying technical skills and approaches to social justice
	- How do we apply what we are learning to SJ concepts? Your project?
- Labs are intended to teach and reinforce GIS skills. We can speed up or slow down
	- Time for discussion as well

## Readings
- Readings are for the day they appear on the modules
- No text to purchase!
- Readings provide perspective, background information, and set the tone for our discussions
- Some of these are controversial, some are challenging, but all relate to GIS and SJ.

## Slides
- Intended as a guide to the discussion and to keep us (well, me) on track
- There will be more images, maps, and interactions!
- Lab slides will be available on BruinLearn after the lab

## Grading
- Scale and breakdown on BruinLearn
- No written exams
- No written final
- Reaction papers
- Project due 5:00 pm on the last day of finals

## Reaction papers
- At least 500 words
- 4 out of 5 graded
- Due (uploaded to BruinLearn) before the discussion
- These are very important!

## Project
- Made with ESRI StoryMaps platform
- This is *not* a course where we will be learning Javascript or python
- Incorporate feedback from your presentation
- Intentions for the project:
	- Demonstrate you can use QGIS to effectively deal with spatial data
	- Use StoryMaps to make that data accessible to the public 

## Presentation
- 5 minutes to cover the project
- Start a discussion with your summary
- Read and provide feedback to others

## Why space,  place, and social justice?

- What do you think of when you hear these terms?
- What about their applicability to UCLA?

## Spatial / Social Justice
- Contention 1: Inequality is rampant and growing in many areas
	- Income bracket, race, etc
- Contention 2: This type of inequality is not beneficial to society or democratic / representative government
	- This is in addition to moral and ethical problems with growing inequality

## Spatial / Social Justice

::: {.incremental}

- Contention 3: Place/space play a critical role in inequality
	- Why? What does space and place have to do with social justice?
- Concept of *Spatial Justice* 
	- In a specific, urban sense focuses on *distributive* and *procedural* justice
:::

## Distributive Justice

>  "...the fair distribution of benefits and burdens in spatial development and how is it decided upon."  
<br />

*https://spatialjustice.blog/distributive-spatial-justice/*, paraphrasing John Rawls

## Distributive Justice
- Fair distribution of burdens and benefits of social interaction in space
	- sought through the creation, fair allocation of and access to public goods, resources and services throughout the city.
- What does this mean for Los Angeles? Can you think of any examples?

## Procedural Justice {.smaller}
- How the burdens and benefits of social interactions in space are decided upon
	- How cities and communities are negotiated, planned, designed and managed
- Are all of these decisions made in a transparent manner?
	-  What voices are included in planning and decision making, which are not?
		- Even if they are heard, can these voices have a real impact on decision making?
- How does this apply to the LA area? Can you think of any historical examples?

## Los Angeles and Spatial Justice{.smaller}

Food inequality

- from LA County Department of Public Helath
	- Food insecurity is more likely to occur among racial and ethnic minorities and low-income communities
	- Due to food options, "...are also at increased risk for poorer health in the long run..."
	- May also lack access to public transportation
	- Food desert: Majority of the population lives over 1 mile away from an affordable grocery store; in rural areas, the distance is 10 miles.
