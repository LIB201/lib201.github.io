Distant Reading\n\n### Distant v. Close Reading\nIf you have been in an English class before, you are familiar with the phrase \"close reading.\" If you have not, close reading refers to choosing part of a text - a word, a symbol, an image - to closely analyze the meaning of the whole work. In other words, why did the author make these word choices? What factors (e.g. historical, intellectual, subliminal, etc.) have gone into influencing the text that show up in this text over and over again? Close reading is one method used analyze a text. Distant reading, which is founded on some of the same principles as close reading, uses computer assistance to process **large** amounts of text, and it is the method we are going to use!\n\n**Distant reading with computers is not a way to replace the levels of interpreting that humans are able to do.** The work of the computer and the work of the text are often at odds, and while our brains will operate differently than a computer's, we are going to explore using the 2 together. In fact, distant reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Thomisticus\">is possible without a computer</a>--the work of the computer just saves time!  Additionally, computationally distant reading loses its impact without the context and interpretation from human eyes. (Here's [a controversial opinion](https://critinq.wordpress.com/2019/04/03/computational-literary-studies-participant-forum-responses-day-3-5/) that even says it is a failure in the humanities! Gasp!) Countless distant reading projects have enhanced, adjusted, or even changed the ways we look at entire works of a specific collection, an author, or even genre. <!--cite these?--> Like close reading, though, distant reading will allow us to address a hypothesis about a text, and through analysis and interpretation, address that hypothesis with textual evidence.\n\nUnlike close reading, distant reading allows us to:\n* Link specific words to the context in which they were used throughout a text (as in a [concordance](https://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/index.age) or scholarly digital edition of an [author's entire works](https://cather.unl.edu/) or just a [single short story](https://digitalpowerhouse.org/)\n* Visualize a single text (or a collection of texts), allowing us to \n    - interact with it graphically and dynamically\n    - compare patterns up close and zoomed out\n    - gain new insight\n    - See [patterns or changes in texts](http://www.cameronblevins.org/posts/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/) over time\n* Compare one author's body of work to another, as in to identify distinctive vocabulary or stylistic patterns (i.e. This person used this word more than that person)\n* Structure a text with\n    - hyperlinks\n    - other metadata\n<!--* Model or predict an explanation-->\n<!--* unsupervised modeling-->\n* and more!\n\n### How do text analyses work?\n\n    \"The difference between the almost right word and the right word is the difference between lightening and a lightening bug\" -Mark Twain\n\nWords are so messy! You and I can understand them only after growing up and speaking a language for many years, and even then, we all have different ways of saying and understanding things! So how does a computer begin to \"understand\" words? With most tools, this is something that goes on automatically in the background, often using a pre-defined list of rules or dictionaries. Let's take a peek behind the curtain!\n\n#### Tokenizing\n\nComputers can recognize characters in sequence. But what words say, and what they mean, aren't always so clear! So in order to have a computer \"read\" something and pull information from it, you have to \"tokenize\" a text. Tokens can be separated by spaces, but they can also be separated by punctuation (hyphens, commas, parentheses), they could be differently capitalized, and they can have different meanings, even though they're spelled the same way. Tokenizing splits words in a sentence into their individual units. <!--use example from letters?-->\n\n    Hello, I am the all-knowing magician!\n \n To a computer, this is just a series of characters. A computer might separate ```all``` from ```knowing``` when tokenized, simply because they are joined by a hyphen. But that changes the meaning of the sentence. By tokenizing, we can tell the computer what and how we want it to read.\n\n* Hello\n* ,\n* I\n* am\n* the\n* all-knowing\n* magician\n* !\n\nIf this sentence were a part of a larger corpus, we might also want to make everything the same case and take out punctuation so all linguistic units (aka words) are treated similarly.\n\n#### Lemmatizing and Stemming\n\nLemmas are root words, or common base words for different variations of a word. Lemmatizing a word is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) process, which groups words by their roots and parts of speech for analysis. Stemming a word removes part of words (plurals, suffixes, alternate endings, etc.) to collapse them into a common word. For example: \n\n| Word | Lemma/Stem |\n|------|--------|\n| good, better, best | good |\n|library, librarian, libraries | librar |\n| sounding (v.), sounds (n.) | sound |\n\nYou can look at all of the instances of the sentiment \"good\" by lemmatizing the words that mean \"good\" (i.e. better and best) at their root. And you can stem all of the variations of library by shortening them to \"librar.\"\n\n#### Stop Words\nIn a large text, <a href=\"https://www.ranks.nl/stopwords\">stop words</a> are words like \"the,\" \"some,\" \"of,\" \"these,\" etc., that you can exclude from analysis because they are determined to be of less value than the other words. But be warned! Sometimes these little words mean a lot! See this blog post about <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/how-data-science-pinpointed-the-creepiest-word-in-macbeth-3150995d3808\">\"the creepiest word in Macbeth\"</a> to see why!\n\nThese methods - tokenizing, lemmatizing, stop words (there are more) - are still not perfect! Think of these methods as formulas that you are performing on a text en masse, and the English language often resists a formula. Think of all of the \"exceptions to the rule\" you have had to learn about. Furthermore, consider texts that are not in English. We use these formulas to help us read a corpus distantly, but that won't replace our abilities to read closely.\n\n<b>These methods are automatic for many tools that we will use, but let's not forget them!</b> When we encounter errors or strange findings, it might be that we need to tweak these settings.\n\n### Check-in\nComplete the [1.Text Analysis check-in](https://muw.instructure.com/courses/19899/quizzes/78684/) before moving on to the next section.\n\n## 2. Select Distant Reading Methods\n\nIn this class, we're going to use specific text analysis methods that are available in the <a href=\"https://libguides.muw.edu/DSL\">Digital Scholar Lab</a>. (Hint: click Databases from the <a href=\"https://www.muw.edu/library\">MUW Library Homepage</a>, and find it under \"D.\"). You'll need to link your Google MyApps account to this database to get started. These are the tools we'll explore...\n\n### N-gram analysis\n\n![Screenshot of a word cloud of William Wordsworth's distinctive vocabulary words in his poems, from Ted Underwood](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/text-analysis-images/ngram-wordsworth.JPG)\n\nN-grams are more commonly known as word clouds. You see words of different sizes, indicating the number of times that word is used throughout the text. The \"N\" in n-gram stands for number of words you are counting or highlighting in a corpus, so you can also do this with phrases. \n\nN-grams also show the patterns of those words as they're used throughout the text over time (time can be literal - as in, throughout the years, as seen in the screenshot below, or it can be relative to the text itself, as in how the word is used throughout the course of the corpus.)\n\n![Screenshot of Robots Reading Vogue, showing the uses of corset, girdle, bra, bustier, and hosiery over time](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/text-analysis-images/ngram-RRV.JPG)\n\nN-grams can also be used to collocate words or phrases and to determine relationships between word pairs. The example below shows how words in Shakespeare's plays with positive connotations are more often associated with male-gendered words.\n\n![Screenshot of Heather Froehlich's analysis of Shakespeare texts, where male-gendered words have more positive connotations (i.e. Man - young) than female-gendered words (i.e. Woman - wretched)](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/text-analysis-images/ngram-shakespeare.JPG)\n\n__You'll use an n-gram analysis to explore word pairs, frequencies, and their use over time.__\n\n### Topic Modeling\n\nTopic Modeling is one of the more difficult text analysis methods because it is based on probability. Topic Modeling uses an algorithm [Latent Direchlet Allocation](https://towardsdatascience.com/latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-9d1cd064ffa2\") to find probabilities of words that co-occur. When you run this algorithm on a body of text, it puts the words that are _more likely_ to occur together in categories, or \"bags of words.\" The idea is that each category represents a topic of discussion in the text. \n\n![Screenshot of Lincoln Sermons Topic keywords split into 10 columns labeled \"topic 1,\" \"topic 2,\" and so on](https://lincolnlogs.digitalscholarship.emory.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mallet.png)\n\nJust like other text analysis methods, topic modeling requires some inference on behalf of the person running the algorithm - how are these groups of words related? How are they used in the text? Do they signify a distinct theme? For instance, all of the words in topic #1 in the image above are probabistically related to each other. At first glance, it looks like they are related to law and policy. It is not always clear what distinct topics are, but knowing about the contents of the text helps! \n\nIn another example, the column labels below were chosen to reflect the commonalities among the words below them.\n\n![Screenshot of topic modeling results with columns labeled Arts, Budgets, Children, and Education, in colors corresponding to highlighted words within a paragraph](https://i.imgur.com/9UesuuB.png)\n\n### Sentiment Analysis\n\n![Screenshot of sentiment analysis of tweets using #nationalsonsday](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/text-analysis-images/SA-sons.JPG)\n\n_Sentiment analysis of tweets using #nationalsonsday from https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/tweet_viz/tweet_app/_\n\n![Screenshot of sentiment analysis of tweets using #nationaldaughtersday](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/text-analysis-images/SA-daughters.JPG)\n\n_Sentiment analysis of tweets using #nationaldaughtersday from https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/tweet_viz/tweet_app/._ \n\nA sentiment analysis uses natural language processing to \"score\" words according to a positive or negative scale. Sentiment analyses are trained on a pre-determined set of words (such as the [AFINN lexicon](http://corpustext.com/reference/sentiment_afinn.html)), and show (or attempt to show) the overall positive or negative emotions at any given moment within a corpus. \n\n![Screenshot of the plot of James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in a sentiment analysis](https://www.matthewjockers.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/poa2.png)\n\nNote: Sentiment analyses have limits! Like toddlers, sentiment analyses **do not** detect sarcasm! :laughing: They also commonly do not account for the change in meanings of words over time (i.e. sick = ill v. sick = slang for cool).\n\nSee an [example LIB 201 project](https://sites.google.com/view/dslsentimentanalysis/home) by Beckie Fuller using content from 3 20th century letter collections to see if positive and negative emotions could be detected!\n\n### Named Entity Recognition\n\nNamed Entity Recognition (or NER) is similar to the previous methods, in that it uses a pre-determined list of words and algorithms to classify words into categories. These categories, or \"named entities\" helps readers identify key people, places, and things (aka \"proper nouns,\" though it's not always limited to these) within a key text. For instance, if you are trying to identify locations in a text, you can use NER to help you identify named cities, counties, etc. Think about the tags you manually created in the letters. This is like an automated version of that!\n\nIn the Digital Scholar Lab, the following categories are used, based on a [commonly used NER module](https://spacy.io/api/data-formats#named-entities):\n\n| Category | Description |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| Number | Numerals that do not fall under another type |\n| Date | Absolute or relative dates or periods |\n| Event | Named hurricanes, battles, wars, sports events, etc. |\n| Place | Buildings, airports, highways, bridges, etc. |\n| Geo-Political Entity | Countries, cities, states |\n| Language | Any named language |\n| Law | Named documents made into laws |\n| Geography | Non-GPE locations, mountain ranges, bodies of water |\n| Money | Monetary values, including unit |\n| Cultural Group | Nationalities or religious or political groups |\n| Position | \"first\", \"second\", etc. |\n| Organization | Companies, agencies, institutions, etc. |\n| Percentage | Percentage, including \"%\" |\n| Person | People, including fictional |\n| Product | Objects, vehicles, foods, etc. (Not services) |\n| Measurement | Measurements, as of weight or distance |\n| Time | A period of time, smaller than a day or 24 hours. |\n| Artwork | Includes titles of books, songs, etc. |\n\n#### Check-in\nComplete the [2.Text Analysis check-in](https://muw.instructure.com/courses/19899/quizzes/78703) here before moving on to the cleaning methods section.\n\n## 3. Text Cleaning Methods\n\nRemember our discussion of tokenization, lemmas, and stop words? In order to remove the inconsistencies and \"noise\" for a computer to analyze texts, you will judicially employ and tinker with some of these processes. Also remember the words of advice from Muñoz and Rawson in [\"Against Cleaning](http://curatingmenus.org/articles/against-cleaning/) when employing these methods!\n\nBefore you even begin to clean individual texts, remember that you are also likely going to select groups of texts from within our collected transcriptions. Depending on what question you'll pursue, you might limit your letters to just be from a certain decade, or from (or to!) a particular individual, etc. Try to aim for enough letters to render your reading a \"distant\" one! (In other words, 10 1-page letters probably won't be enough! Aim higher!)\n\n![Screenshot of text cleaning configurations in the Digital Scholar Lab](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/text-analysis-images/DSLAB_CreateCleanConfig_Corrections.jpg)\n<!--https://go.gale.com/ps/helpCenter?userGroupName=mag_u_muw&inPS=true&nspage=true&prodId=DSLAB&docId=GVOFKU762720149-->\n\n### Upper v. lower case\nIn some cases, a text analysis tool will treat words differently if they are in different cases. Remember, computers see strings of characters, and are as frustratingly literal as possible! This cleaning method eliminates the possibility of the computer treating the words ```Mother``` and ```mother``` differently. There could be a scenario when you'd like them to be different (i.e. maybe they say \"Mother\" as her name, but refer to her as \"mother\" to each other), so keep that in mind!\n\n### Character removal, or \"Scrubbing\"\nThis method allows you to programmatically remove or replace characters, words, or lemmas. This is common for a text that is read through OCR recognition (when you scan a document instead of transcribe it, and a computer tries to recognize the characters). Often OCR will substitute characters or images with non-letter symbols, like Ê, §, ¶, ¥, or %. This is less likely to happen with transcriptions.\n\nHowever, removing punctuation might be helpful, especially since letter writers use punctuation differently! Furthermore, if you are analyzing the body of the letter, you will want to remove the part of the text that includes the envelope and letter head. Consider the different ways to do this (stop words, cutting the beginning of all the letters, removing line breaks, etc.) <!--Check-in question?-->\n\n### Replacements\nLike the ctrl+F function, replacing items across the board is another way to clean a text. (Remember doing this for the network analysis?) This could be helpful with things like abbreviations, nicknames, inconsistencies in spelling, etc.\n\n### Stop words\nIn the previous section, we talked about removing words with \"little value\" (poor little words!), which you can alter according to the specifications of the text you're dealing with. This also applies to words that are endemic to the colleciton. For instance, you might see the word \"Mississippi\" over and over again, and think, well duh! If your analysis reveals \"Mississippi\" as a significant word that you aren't really interested in, add it to your stop words.\n\nIn different tools, you will separate these words differently (spaces, commas, or line breaks). \n\n#### Check-in\nUse this check-in to sketch out your main point of inquiry using text analysis. This will require more thinking through your text analysis assignment, so be sure to think through possible options, and you might even read through more letters before completing this.\nComplete the [3.Text Analysis check-in](https://muw.instructure.com/courses/19899/quizzes/78696) to complete this lesson.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Overview \nIn addition to the important things to analyze in the letters, like places, people, and themes, there's also _the text_.

The \"N\" in n-gram stands for number of words you are counting or highlighting in a corpus, so you can also do this with phrases. \n\nN-grams also show the patterns of those words as they're used throughout the text over time (time can be literal - as in, throughout the years, as seen in the screenshot below, or it can be relative to the text itself, as in how the word is used throughout the course of the corpus.)\n\n![Screenshot of Robots Reading Vogue, showing the uses of corset, girdle, bra, bustier, and hosiery over time](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/text-analysis-images/ngram-RRV.JPG)\n\nN-grams can also be used to collocate words or phrases and to determine relationships between word pairs. The example below shows how words in Shakespeare's plays with positive connotations are more often associated with male-gendered words.\n\n![Screenshot of Heather Froehlich's analysis of Shakespeare texts, where male-gendered words have more positive connotations (i.e. Man - young) than female-gendered words (i.e. Woman - wretched)](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/text-analysis-images/ngram-shakespeare.JPG)\n\n__You'll use an n-gram analysis to explore word pairs, frequencies, and their use over time.__\n\n### Topic Modeling\n\nTopic Modeling is one of the more difficult text analysis methods because it is based on probability. Topic Modeling uses an algorithm [Latent Direchlet Allocation](https://towardsdatascience.com/latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-9d1cd064ffa2\") to find probabilities of words that co-occur. When you run this algorithm on a body of text, it puts the words that are _more likely_ to occur together in categories, or \"bags of words.\" The idea is that each category represents a topic of discussion in the text. \n\n![Screenshot of Lincoln Sermons Topic keywords split into 10 columns labeled \"topic 1,\" \"topic 2,\" and so on](https://lincolnlogs.digitalscholarship.emory.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mallet.png)\n\nJust like other text analysis methods, topic modeling requires some inference on behalf of the person running the algorithm - how are these groups of words related? How are they used in the text? Do they signify a distinct theme? For instance, all of the words in topic #1 in the image above are probabistically related to each other. At first glance, it looks like they are related to law and policy. It is not always clear what distinct topics are, but knowing about the contents of the text helps! \n\nIn another example, the column labels below were chosen to reflect the commonalities among the words below them.\n\n![Screenshot of topic modeling results with columns labeled Arts, Budgets, Children, and Education, in colors corresponding to highlighted words within a paragraph](https://i.imgur.com/9UesuuB.png)\n\n### Sentiment Analysis\n\n![Screenshot of sentiment analysis of tweets using #nationalsonsday](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/text-analysis-images/SA-sons.JPG)\n\n_Sentiment analysis of tweets using #nationalsonsday from https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/tweet_viz/tweet_app/_\n\n![Screenshot of sentiment analysis of tweets using #nationaldaughtersday](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/text-analysis-images/SA-daughters.JPG)\n\n_Sentiment analysis of tweets using #nationaldaughtersday from https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/tweet_viz/tweet_app/._ \n\nA sentiment analysis uses natural language processing to \"score\" words according to a positive or negative scale. Sentiment analyses are trained on a pre-determined set of words (such as the [AFINN lexicon](http://corpustext.com/reference/sentiment_afinn.html)), and show (or attempt to show) the overall positive or negative emotions at any given moment within a corpus. \n\n![Screenshot of the plot of James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in a sentiment analysis](https://www.matthewjockers.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/poa2.png)\n\nNote: Sentiment analyses have limits! Like toddlers, sentiment analyses **do not** detect sarcasm! :laughing: They also commonly do not account for the change in meanings of words over time (i.e. sick = ill v. sick = slang for cool).\n\nSee an [example LIB 201 project](https://sites.google.com/view/dslsentimentanalysis/home) by Beckie Fuller using content from 3 20th century letter collections to see if positive and negative emotions could be detected!\n\n### Named Entity Recognition\n\nNamed Entity Recognition (or NER) is similar to the previous methods, in that it uses a pre-determined list of words and algorithms to classify words into categories. These categories, or \"named entities\" helps readers identify key people, places, and things (aka \"proper nouns,\" though it's not always limited to these) within a key text. For instance, if you are trying to identify locations in a text, you can use NER to help you identify named cities, counties, etc. Think about the tags you manually created in the letters. This is like an automated version of that!\n\nIn the Digital Scholar Lab, the following categories are used, based on a [commonly used NER module](https://spacy.io/api/data-formats#named-entities):\n\n| Category | Description |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| Number | Numerals that do not fall under another type |\n| Date | Absolute or relative dates or periods |\n| Event | Named hurricanes, battles, wars, sports events, etc. |\n| Place | Buildings, airports, highways, bridges, etc. |\n| Geo-Political Entity | Countries, cities, states |\n| Language | Any named language |\n| Law | Named documents made into laws |\n| Geography | Non-GPE locations, mountain ranges, bodies of water |\n| Money | Monetary values, including unit |\n| Cultural Group | Nationalities or religious or political groups |\n| Position | \"first\", \"second\", etc. |\n| Organization | Companies, agencies, institutions, etc. |\n| Percentage | Percentage, including \"%\" |\n| Person | People, including fictional |\n| Product | Objects, vehicles, foods, etc. (Not services) |\n| Measurement | Measurements, as of weight or distance |\n| Time | A period of time, smaller than a day or 24 hours. |\n| Artwork | Includes titles of books, songs, etc. |\n\n#### Check-in\nComplete the [2.Text Analysis check-in](https://muw.instructure.com/courses/19899/quizzes/78703) here before moving on to the cleaning methods section.\n\n## 3. Text Cleaning Methods\n\nRemember our discussion of tokenization, lemmas, and stop words? In order to remove the inconsistencies and \"noise\" for a computer to analyze texts, you will judicially employ and tinker with some of these processes. Also remember the words of advice from Muñoz and Rawson in [\"Against Cleaning](http://curatingmenus.org/articles/against-cleaning/) when employing these methods!\n\nBefore you even begin to clean individual texts, remember that you are also likely going to select groups of texts from within our collected transcriptions. Depending on what question you'll pursue, you might limit your letters to just be from a certain decade, or from (or to!) a particular individual, etc. Try to aim for enough letters to render your reading a \"distant\" one! (In other words, 10 1-page letters probably won't be enough! Aim higher!)\n\n![Screenshot of text cleaning configurations in the Digital Scholar Lab](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/text-analysis-images/DSLAB_CreateCleanConfig_Corrections.jpg)\n<!--https://go.gale.com/ps/helpCenter?userGroupName=mag_u_muw&inPS=true&nspage=true&prodId=DSLAB&docId=GVOFKU762720149-->\n\n### Upper v. lower case\nIn some cases, a text analysis tool will treat words differently if they are in different cases. Remember, computers see strings of characters, and are as frustratingly literal as possible! This cleaning method eliminates the possibility of the computer treating the words ```Mother``` and ```mother``` differently. There could be a scenario when you'd like them to be different (i.e. maybe they say \"Mother\" as her name, but refer to her as \"mother\" to each other), so keep that in mind!\n\n### Character removal, or \"Scrubbing\"\nThis method allows you to programmatically remove or replace characters, words, or lemmas. This is common for a text that is read through OCR recognition (when you scan a document instead of transcribe it, and a computer tries to recognize the characters). Often OCR will substitute characters or images with non-letter symbols, like Ê, §, ¶, ¥, or %. This is less likely to happen with transcriptions.\n\nHowever, removing punctuation might be helpful, especially since letter writers use punctuation differently! Furthermore, if you are analyzing the body of the letter, you will want to remove the part of the text that includes the envelope and letter head. Consider the different ways to do this (stop words, cutting the beginning of all the letters, removing line breaks, etc.) <!--Check-in question?-->\n\n### Replacements\nLike the ctrl+F function, replacing items across the board is another way to clean a text. (Remember doing this for the network analysis?) This could be helpful with things like abbreviations, nicknames, inconsistencies in spelling, etc.\n\n### Stop words\nIn the previous section, we talked about removing words with \"little value\" (poor little words!), which you can alter according to the specifications of the text you're dealing with. This also applies to words that are endemic to the colleciton. For instance, you might see the word \"Mississippi\" over and over again, and think, well duh! If your analysis reveals \"Mississippi\" as a significant word that you aren't really interested in, add it to your stop words.\n\nIn different tools, you will separate these words differently (spaces, commas, or line breaks). \n\n#### Check-in\nUse this check-in to sketch out your main point of inquiry using text analysis. This will require more thinking through your text analysis assignment, so be sure to think through possible options, and you might even read through more letters before completing this.\nComplete the
